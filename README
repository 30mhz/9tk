Usage:
	 backup.py <cmd> <expiration>

<cmd>: snapshot or purge
<expiration>: hourly (default), daily, weekly, monthly

This command expects userdata with at least the following values
{
    "access_key_id" : "",
    "secret_access_key" : "",
    "backups" : {
      "domain" : "snapshots.9apps.net",
      "schedule" : ["hourly", "daily", "weekly", "monthly"],
      "expiration" : [1, 7, 28, 365],
      "hourly" : "15 */2 * * *",
      "daily" : "@daily",
      "weekly" : "@weekly",
      "monthly" : "@monthly"
    }
}

Most of these are necessary, but "schedule", "expiration", "hourly", "daily", "weekly", "monthly" have sensible defaults. They are shown to illustrate they can be overwritten.

Requirements: python + boto and proper credentials, of course.
    All devices to be snapshotted should be XFS.
